    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How Long to Roast a Chicken</h1>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, a 3-pound whole chicken should be completely cooked in a little more than an hour. 
        You'll know it's done when the meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, 
        and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (near the bone) reads 165 degrees F.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Roasted Chicken Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The most important thing to know, according to Nicole: "Dry skin is crispy skin." 
            Make sure you get the skin nice and dry with a paper towel before you season the chicken.</li>
        <li>"Don't forget to season the inside as well as the outside," 
            says Nicole, who recommends also getting under the skin with butter for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>If you don't have a roasting pan, that's totally fine. 
            Nicole prefers using a simple baking sheet with a rack on top.</li>
        <li>To prevent the wings from burning during the long roasting process, 
            Nicole tucks them under the bird before sticking the chicken in the oven.</li>
